<br/>

## Period

- In 2022, the second semester of the third grade


## Contents

**1. Lab 1**

- Java Crash Course

- Goals

  - Understand Java syntax
  
  - Compare the syntax of the programming languages that you already know with the syntax of Java
  
  - Understand similarities and differences between Java syntax and other programming languagesâ€™ syntax
<br/>

**2. Lab 2**

- Goals

  - Learn how to use version control system, git, for tracking code changes in your code repository

  - Learn basic shell commands for using git
  
  - Learn how to use IntelliJ (editing and executing code)
<br/> 

**3. Lab 3**

- Goals

  - To learn how to debug software efficiently using IntelliJ
  
    - Set breakpoints in the code for debugging
    
    - Run Java programs in debug mode
    
    - Run Java code step by step using IntelliJ (step into, step over, step out, resume program, evaluate expression, etc.)

  - Unit testing with JUnit in IntelliJ
  
  - To play with IntList (preparation for the next programming assignment)
<br/>

**4. Lab 4**

- Goals

  - Learn how to write more advanced tests using JUnit with SLList and AList that we learned in the lectures

  - Practice and understand performance difference between SLList (Linked List) and AList (Array-based List) through timing tests
  
    - Also practice different resizing strategies for AList
  
  - Write randomized tests to catch tricky bugs and fix them
  
  - Learn more advanced debugging techniques, including conditional breakpoints and Java Visualizer in IntelliJ
<br/>

**5. Lab 5**

- Goals

  - Use Make and Makefile, powerful tools for software engineers

  - Learn Java File I/O, how to manipulate files and directories programmatically
  
  - Use Serializable interface: serialization for storing program states in a binary format (a series of bytes) and deserialization for loading program states
  
  - Learn integration tests
  
  - Learn how to debug remotely using IntelliJ (Mandatory Epilogue: Debugging section)
  
  - Get ready for the next programming assignment (Gitlet)
<br/>

**6. Lab 6**

- Go over the questions in the lab instructions with your partner for LinkedListDeque & ArrayDeque

  - What was the most annoying bug you had and how did you fix it? Did you use the debugger? 
    Did you fix it by adding special cases? Did you do any change-and-pray (where you make a tiny 
    change and hope the AG (Autograder) approves)?
    
  - Did you end up cutting anything out to make your code simpler? If so, what?
  
  - Do you have any special cases in your code?
  
  - Do you have any private helper methods?
  
  - Does your code repeat itself anywhere? Would private helper methods have helped?
  
  - Were you able to call or reuse code anywhere
